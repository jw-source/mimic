Here is the experimental design extracted from the provided research paper excerpt, focusing on the described Ultimatum Game experiments:

**1. Goal and purpose of the experiment:**

The overarching goal across the experiments is to test the predictions of game theory, specifically the Rubinstein model, in the context of the Ultimatum Game.  Game theory predicts that in a simple ultimatum game, the Allocator (Player 1) should offer the minimum possible amount (approaching zero), and the Recipient (Player 2) should accept any positive offer since something is better than nothing. The purpose of these experiments is to empirically investigate whether human behavior in bargaining situations aligns with these rational, self-interested predictions or deviates from them due to factors like fairness considerations.  Different experiments further explore:

*   Whether the initial findings of deviations from game theory persist across variations in stakes, repetition, game structure, and participant understanding.
*   The role of fairness and strategic considerations in Allocator's offers.
*   Recipients' willingness to reject positive but "unfair" offers.
*   The impact of game complexity and experience on strategic behavior.
*   Whether fairness considerations are robust to changes in game parameters (like stake size, number of rounds, discount factor).

**2. Independent variables and their ranges/values used:**

Across the various experiments, the key independent variables manipulated are:

*   **Stake size (c):** The amount of money to be divided.  Values used included:
    *   DM 4 and DM 10 (German Marks) in GSS initial experiment.
    *   DM 7 and DM 7 again in GSS second experiment.
    *   $10 (Canadian) in KKT replication of GSS.
    *   $20 (US) in KKT "dictator game" variation (no rejection option).
    *   100 UK pence in BSS experiment (equivalent to c = $10 in Thaler's example).
    *   DM 5, DM 15, and DM 35 in Güth and Tietz's two-stage game.
    *   $5 and $15 in NSS multi-stage games.
    *   100 "chips" worth varying amounts (initial round $30) in Ochs and Roth.
*   **Game Structure/Number of Stages:**
    *   **One-stage Ultimatum Game:**  Basic version where Player 1 makes an offer and Player 2 accepts or rejects (GSS, KKT replications).
    *   **Two-stage Bargaining Game:** If Player 2 rejects in stage 1, roles reverse in stage 2 with a reduced stake (BSS, Güth and Tietz).
    *   **Multi-stage Games (2, 3, and 5 rounds):**  Multiple rounds of offer/counter-offer with predetermined discount factors (NSS, Ochs and Roth).
    *   **Dictator Game Variation:**  Player 1 makes an offer, and Player 2 *must* accept; rejection is not an option (KKT second experiment - first part).
*   **Discount Factor (δ):** In multi-stage games, this factor reduces the stake in subsequent rounds (BSS δ=0.25, Güth and Tietz δ=0.1 and δ=0.9, Ochs and Roth used combinations of δ<sub>1</sub> and δ<sub>2</sub>).
*   **Instructions to Subjects:**  BSS explicitly instructed subjects to maximize winnings; Hoffman and Spitzer manipulated instructions regarding "earned" vs. "designated" roles, and "earned rights" vs. "designated roles" as Allocators.
*   **Subject Experience:**  GSS's initial experiment compared behavior in the first trial with a replication a week later (inexperienced vs. slightly experienced). Ochs and Roth used 10 repetitions to observe learning effects.
*   **Role Determination:** Hoffman and Spitzer manipulated whether the Allocator role was determined by a coin flip or by winning a game, and whether roles were described as "earned" or "designated".

**3. Dependent variables and how they were measured:**

*   **Offer Amount (by Allocator/Player 1):**  Measured in currency units (DM, $, pence, chips) or as a proportion of the total stake (e.g., .37c, .45c).  This was directly stated by participants designated as Player 1.
*   **Minimum Acceptable Offer (by Recipient/Player 2 or elicited from both roles):**
    *   In GSS second experiment and KKT studies, subjects indicated the minimum offer they would accept when in the role of Recipient.
    *   In KKT, this was assessed through a series of yes/no questions for offers increasing in 50-cent increments.
*   **Acceptance or Rejection Rate (of offers by Recipient/Player 2):**  Recorded as counts or percentages of offers accepted or rejected.
*   **Reservation Demand (in two-stage games):**  Indicated by Player 2 when they become the Allocator in the second stage.
*   **Choice of Allocation (in two-choice Dictator Game):** Whether Allocators chose the even split ($10-$10) or the uneven split ($18-$2) in KKT's dictator game variation.
*   **Choice of Partner (in KKT's third-party punishment experiment):**  Whether subjects chose to split money with a "generous" (E) or "ungenerous" (U) past Allocator.
*   **Earnings/Payoffs:**  Calculated based on game outcomes and offers, although often not explicitly stated in detail for every experiment summarized in this review article due to focus being on offers and rejections.

**4. Control variables and their fixed values:**

While the paper does not explicitly list every control variable, the following are implicitly controlled or held constant across conditions within each experiment:

*   **Anonymity:** In most experiments, Player 1 and Player 2 are anonymous to each other to minimize social pressure and reputation effects (unless explicitly manipulated, such as manipulations of social distance).
*   **Subject Pool:** Typically economics students or university students, though some variations used psychology or commerce students (KKT). Homogenizing the subject pool to some degree is a form of control.
*   **Game Rules:** The rules of the Ultimatum Game (or its variations) are clearly defined and consistently applied within each experiment to maintain a standardized interaction scenario.
*   **Information about Rules:**  Subjects are given advance explanations of the game rules and payoff structures to ensure understanding before making decisions.  KKT made extra effort to confirm subject understanding via diagnostic questions.
*   **Currency/Stakes denomination:**  While stake sizes varied, within each experiment, the currency unit and the value represented by it was consistent.
*   **Random Matching (opponent):**  In repeated play settings (like Ochs and Roth), participants were matched with a *different* anonymous opponent each round to prevent repeated game dynamics, essentially keeping interactions as one-shot games each round.

**5. Experimental conditions and their specific parameters:**

The experimental conditions directly correspond to the variations in the independent variables. Examples include:

*   **GSS Initial Experiment:**  Stake sizes c = DM 4, DM 10; One-stage Ultimatum game; inexperienced subjects.
*   **KKT Replication:** Stake size c = $10 (Canadian); One-stage Ultimatum game; subjects given diagnostic questions.
*   **KKT Dictator Game:** Stake = $20(US); Two choices: $18-$2 or $10-$10 split; no rejection possible.
*   **BSS Two-Stage Game:** Stake c = 100 pence; Discount factor δ=0.25; Two stages with role reversal; Instructions to maximize winnings.
*   **Güth and Tietz Two-Stage Game:** Stakes c = DM 5, DM 15, DM 35; Discount factors δ=0.1 and δ=0.9; Two stages with role reversal (and constraint on counter-offer).
*   **NSS Multi-stage Games:** Series of games with 2, 3, and 5 rounds; c = $5 and $15; Varying discount rates leading to equilibrium offer of $1.26 in first round.
*   **Ochs and Roth Experiment:** 2x4 factorial design: Number of periods (2 or 3) crossed with four discount factor combinations (δ<sub>1</sub>, δ<sub>2</sub>) = (.4,.4), (.6,.4), (.6,.6), (.4,.6); 10 bargaining rounds per condition.

**6. Number of trials/iterations/samples:**

*   **GSS Initial Experiment:** 42 economics students (21 Allocators, 21 Recipients), unclear number of games per subject reported in this summary, but likely one per pair initially then repeated after a week.
*   **GSS Second Experiment (Recipients only):** 37 new subjects.
*   **KKT Replication:** 137 subjects initially, 22 dropped for failing diagnostic questions, so 115 used. Number of games unclear.
*   **KKT Dictator Game:** 161 subjects for the dictator game part, same subjects for the third-party punishment part. Eight pairs were randomly chosen to be paid.
*   **BSS Experiments:** Sample size not explicitly stated, but implied to be reasonable for observing percentages of offer types and rejections. First game and a second game with role reversal were conducted.
*   **Güth and Tietz Two-Stage Game:**  Number of subjects not precisely specified, but games were played twice with role reversal, and stakes and discount factors were varied.
*   **NSS Multi-stage Games:** 50 Allocators ("sellers") and 50 Recipients ("buyers") per game length (2, 3, 5 rounds). Subjects played each game length once with a different partner, after a 4-round practice game.  Second experiment with 5-round game repeated four times with payoffs * 3.
*   **Ochs and Roth Experiment:** Number of subjects not directly stated but implied to be enough to fill the 4x2 experimental cells over 10 trials each. Implied multiple subjects per cell in each of the 10 trials, though exact count is not given in this excerpt.

**7. Any specific thresholds or cutoff values used:**

*   **Minimum acceptable offer (Recipient):** Often implicitly considered at DM 1 or $0.50 (e.g., increments in KKT).  Offers below DM 1 were considered very low.  Offers of a penny were considered theoretically minimal but practically risky.
*   **Rejection threshold:** An implicit threshold for fairness perceptions. Offers below a certain level are deemed "insulting" or "unfair" leading to rejection, deviating from purely rational acceptance of any positive offer.
*   In Güth and Tietz's two-stage game with δ = 0.1, offers higher than .1c effectively became ultimatum as Player 2 couldn't counter below the offered amount and rejection meant disagreement for both.

**8. Qualitative and quantitative results of the experiment, including their significance and interpretation:**

**General Qualitative Findings:**

*   **Rejection of positive offers:** Recipients frequently reject offers that are positive but considered "unfair" (typically low offers relative to the total stake). This is a consistent finding across most studies and contradicts the game theory prediction.
*   **"Generous" offers by Allocators:** Allocators often offer significantly more than the minimal amount predicted by game theory, with modal offers frequently around 50% split, especially in earlier trials and simple games.  This also deviates from rational self-interest.
*   **"Fairness" as a Motivator:** Data suggests that fairness considerations (both for oneself and potentially for others) are significant motivators in ultimatum game behavior, overriding purely self-interested wealth maximization.
*   **Influence of Game Structure/Complexity:** As game complexity increases (multi-stage games), and with experience, behavior *sometimes* moves slightly closer to game-theoretic predictions, but still with substantial deviations, particularly in longer games (like 3 and 5 round NSS games).
*   **Context and Framing Effects:**  Perceptions of fairness are influenced by contextual factors, e.g., the "fancy resort hotel" vs. "run-down grocery store" beer scenario affects acceptable price.  Framing of roles (earned vs. designated) also impacts offers.
*   **Limited Learning/Rationality:** Even with repetition (Ochs and Roth), and even among MBA students trained in game theory (exam question example), subjects often don't fully adopt or understand game-theoretic optimal strategies.

**Quantitative Results and Significance (Summarized by experiment type):**

*   **GSS Initial Experiment:** Modal offer 50% split; Mean offer .37c; Rejection rate of positive offers observed. Replication showed slightly less generous offers (mean .32c) but still above theoretical minimum, with a rejection rate of 5/21 offers in the replication round.

*   **KKT Replications:** Mean minimum acceptable offers consistently around $2.00-$2.59 (out of $10 stake), similar to GSS findings.  This is significantly greater than zero and confirms rejection of low offers.

*   **KKT Dictator Game:**  76% of Allocators chose the even $10-$10 split even when rejection wasn't possible. This suggests a taste for fairness beyond fear of rejection explaining generous offers in Ultimatum Game. 74% chose to reward "generous" stranger over "greedy" stranger in third-party choice, indicating willingness to punish unfairness towards others.

*   **BSS Two-Stage Game:** First game offers similar to ultimatum game (modal 50 pence, mean > theory), 15% rejections. Second game with experienced Player 1s showed offers *closer* to equilibrium, but still not fully at theoretical levels. BSS concluded fairness is "displaced by strategic advantage," but Thaler questions their interpretation due to experimental design flaws (instructions and info revelation).

*   **Güth and Tietz Two-Stage Game:**  Results did *not* support BSS conclusion. Offers moved *away* from equilibrium with repetition or changes in discount factor δ.  Stake size (c) had limited impact on improving game theory predictions.

*   **NSS Multi-stage Games:** Two-round games *closer* to game theory, but 3 and 5 round games deviated significantly. 3-round game had modal offer at 50% split despite equilibrium being $1.26. 5-round game modal offer at $1.70, again far from equilibrium.  NSS noted subjects seemed to "anchor" offers to the next period's stake, indicating myopic or risk-averse behavior.  Increased stake size in repetition (c=$15) did not change the patterns significantly.

*   **Ochs and Roth Experiment:**  Theory performed poorly across most cells of their 2x4 design. Theoretical mean offer rarely within 2 standard deviations of actual mean. Discount factor for Player 1 had unexpected effects, and game length (2 vs 3 periods) did not have predicted effects.  Regression of observed offers on theoretical offers yielded very low R<sup>2</sup> (.065) and coefficient close to zero, showing very weak descriptive power of game theory.  Replicated finding that Recipient's counter offers often demanded *less* than they were initially offered, reinforcing non-monetary utility arguments.

**Interpretation:**

The collective results of these experiments strongly suggest that:

*   **Behavioral anomalies exist:**  Observed behavior in Ultimatum Games deviates significantly and systematically from the predictions of standard game theory based on rationality and self-interest.
*   **Fairness is a significant factor:**  Fairness considerations (both as a preference and as a strategic concern) play a crucial role in shaping bargaining behavior, influencing both Allocators' offers and Recipients' rejection decisions.
*   **Game theory as a *normative* vs. *descriptive/prescriptive* tool:** Game theory, as traditionally formulated, may be more useful as a normative (how *should* rational agents behave) than a positive or descriptive (how *do* people behave) or prescriptive (how to advise people to behave) model in bargaining situations.
*   **Need for more complex/behavioral game theories:** To better understand and predict bargaining behavior, models need to incorporate factors like fairness, emotions, bounded rationality, and contextual influences, moving beyond purely self-interest and perfect rationality assumptions. The research points towards the need for *prescriptive* game theory that considers both rationality and opponent’s likely bounded rationality and fairness perceptions.
